# Guidance for Readers

This repository contains a speculative analytical framework (SEED v1.0) developed to explore how **constraints, not intent**, might shape rare anomalous observations under extreme uncertainty.

Before engaging with the material, please read this guidance carefully.

---

## How to Read This Repository

- Read the **core framework document** first (`SEED_v1.0.md`)
- Treat all supporting documents as **contextual lenses**, not extensions
- Pay attention to **what is excluded**, not just what is discussed
- Notice where ambiguity is preserved rather than resolved

This project is designed to be **read slowly and conservatively**.

---

## What This Repository Is For

This repository exists to:

- Explore how constraint-driven systems might behave *if they existed*
- Provide a disciplined way to think about unresolved anomalies
- Reduce narrative inflation and belief-based interpretation
- Encourage falsifiability, restraint, and scope awareness
- Serve as a conceptual tool, not a conclusion

It is intended for analytical readers, not for persuasion.

---

## What This Repository Is Not For

This repository is **not** intended to:

- Prove the existence of non-human intelligence
- Validate or invalidate personal experiences
- Explain all anomalous phenomena
- Replace psychological, sociological, or scientific inquiry
- Support disclosure narratives or conspiratorial thinking
- Function as a belief system or worldview

If you are seeking certainty, resolution, or confirmation, this framework will likely be unsatisfying.

---

## How to Engage Responsibly

If you choose to engage with this material:

- Treat SEED as a **filter**, not an explanation
- Apply it only after ruling out simpler explanations
- Expect most cases to be rejected
- Be comfortable leaving questions unanswered
- Avoid extending the framework beyond its stated scope

Correct usage often ends in **non-application**.

---

## How to Critique This Framework

Substantive critique is welcome when it focuses on:

- Internal logical consistency
- Scope violations
- Unstated assumptions
- Falsifiability conditions
- Alternative models that explain the same patterns with fewer constraints

Critique is less productive when it attempts to:
- Argue belief or disbelief
- Demand answers the framework does not claim to provide
- Apply SEED universally
- Expand it into speculative mechanisms

---

## A Note on Uncertainty

Uncertainty is not a temporary flaw in this framework.
It is a **predicted and stable outcome**.

SEED is built on the premise that some systems—if they exist—may remain
ambiguous regardless of observation, effort, or interpretation.

Discomfort with ambiguity is a human response, not a signal of failure.

---

## Final Message

This repository does not ask you to believe anything.

It asks you to consider whether **constraint-first reasoning** can clarify
why some questions remain unanswered without assuming intent, meaning,
or resolution.

If you finish reading and conclude that SEED is unnecessary or incorrect,
that is a valid and expected outcome.

Restraint applies to readers as much as it applies to the framework itself.
