# Development Process

This framework was developed through an iterative collaboration between a human author and an AI language model, with the human author retaining full editorial control, judgment, and responsibility for all final content.

The role of the AI was strictly supportive: assisting with structuring ideas, stress-testing internal consistency, identifying logical gaps, and helping articulate constraints clearly. The AI did not supply empirical claims, assert truth, or introduce factual conclusions independently.

## Methodology

The development process followed several guiding principles:

- **Constraint-first reasoning**  
  Ideas were evaluated based on what *could not* be assumed, rather than what might be true.

- **Epistemic caution**  
  At each stage, claims were narrowed, qualified, or removed unless they were strictly necessary for internal coherence.

- **Non-anthropocentric framing**  
  The framework was intentionally constructed to avoid human-centered assumptions about intent, communication, meaning, or narrative.

- **Falsifiability and scope control**  
  The framework was repeatedly refactored to ensure it could be challenged, bounded, or rejected based on observable conditions.

- **Stopping discipline**  
  Development halted once the framework reached internal coherence without requiring further speculative extension.

## Role of AI Assistance

AI assistance was used to:

- Refactor drafts for clarity and internal consistency
- Identify implicit assumptions and surface them explicitly
- Propose alternative interpretations for stress-testing
- Help formalize definitions and structure
- Assist in drafting neutral, non-sensational language

AI assistance was *not* used to:
- Assert factual claims
- Provide empirical validation
- Introduce speculative mechanisms as truths
- Replace human judgment or authorship

All final decisions regarding inclusion, exclusion, wording, and scope were made by the human author.

## Authorship and Responsibility

This framework represents a **human-authored analytical model**.

The AI functioned as an advanced drafting and reasoning aid, similar to a technical editor or logic-checking tool. Responsibility for the framework’s assumptions, limitations, and interpretations rests entirely with the human author.

## Status

SEED v1.0 is considered complete.  
No further development is planned unless prompted by new, external information or substantive critique.

This document is provided for transparency regarding process, not as evidence supporting the framework’s claims.

## Final Note

The inclusion of this development note is not intended to elevate or diminish the framework, but to clarify *how* it was produced and to prevent misinterpretation of AI involvement.

The framework should be evaluated solely on its internal coherence, stated limitations, and explicit falsifiability criteria.
