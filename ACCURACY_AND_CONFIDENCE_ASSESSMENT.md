# Accuracy and Confidence Assessment (Conditional)

This document evaluates the **internal coherence** and **external applicability** of the SEED v1.0 framework, and provides **explicit confidence estimates** for each dimension.

All confidence values are **subjective, non-empirical estimates** intended to communicate relative strength, not probability of truth. They should not be interpreted as statistical measures.

---

## Framing and Limits

- Confidence estimates reflect *model quality*, not reality
- High coherence does not imply correctness
- External fit does not imply causation
- All percentages are conditional and revisable

This assessment distinguishes between:
1. How well the framework holds together internally
2. How well it makes sense when applied to external observations

---

## 1. Internal Coherence Assessment

### Definition

Internal coherence measures whether SEED v1.0:
- Is logically self-consistent
- Avoids internal contradiction
- Maintains scope discipline
- Preserves falsifiability
- Avoids ad hoc assumptions
- Explains its own constraints without circularity

### Findings

SEED v1.0 demonstrates:
- Clear separation of assumptions, implications, and speculation
- Strong alignment between constraints and predicted behavior
- Consistent use of restraint as an explanatory driver
- Explicit stopping points and falsification criteria
- No reliance on unfalsifiable mechanisms

Minor weaknesses include:
- Dependence on inferred cognitive orientation
- Reliance on absence patterns (which are inherently ambiguous)

### Internal Coherence Confidence

**Estimated confidence: 85–90%**

This reflects:
- High logical consistency
- Clear scope control
- Low internal tension

The remaining uncertainty reflects:
- Inherent limits of speculative frameworks
- Reliance on behavioral inference rather than empirical grounding

---

## 2. External Applicability Assessment

### Definition

External applicability measures how well SEED:
- Aligns with a narrow subset of anomalous reports
- Competes with alternative explanations without overreach
- Avoids contradiction with known psychology, sociology, and physics
- Explains why ambiguity persists rather than resolves

This assessment does *not* measure whether SEED is true.

---

## 3. Fit to Anomalous Observations

### Observed Alignment

When applied conservatively, SEED aligns with:
- Rare cases featuring minimal disclosure
- Lack of artifacts or persistent evidence
- Procedural or non-narrative interaction
- Absence of escalation or follow-up
- Long-term ambiguity without resolution

SEED explicitly excludes:
- Richly narrative encounters
- Ideological or prophetic content
- Artifact transfer claims
- Repeated or escalating engagement

### External Fit Confidence (Selective Domain)

**Estimated confidence: 20–30%**

Interpretation:
- SEED plausibly accounts for a *small fraction* of cases
- It neither explains nor attempts to explain most reports
- Competing explanations remain equally or more plausible in many instances

This low percentage is **expected** and **appropriate** given the framework’s narrow scope.

---

## 4. Comparison to Competing Explanations

When compared to:
- Psychological models
- Sociological and cultural transmission effects
- Classified or experimental human technology
- Sensor artifacts and misinterpretation

SEED performs best when:
- Those explanations fail to fully account for persistent restraint and ambiguity
- No strategic or communicative motive is evident
- Absence patterns dominate presence patterns

However:
- SEED does not outperform these explanations globally
- It should be treated as *one lens among several*, not a replacement

---

## 5. Detection Bias and Survivorship Effects

External assessment is complicated by:
- Reporting bias
- Cultural filtering
- Retrospective reinterpretation
- Uneven data quality
- Institutional opacity

These factors reduce confidence in any external model, including SEED.

## 6. Overall Confidence Summary

| Dimension                     | Estimated Confidence |
|------------------------------|----------------------|
| Internal coherence            | 85–90%               |
| External applicability        | 20–30%               |
| Overreach risk                | Low                  |
| Falsifiability integrity      | High                 |
| Risk of belief inflation      | Low                  |

---

## 7. Interpretation Guidance

- High internal coherence means the framework is *well-constructed*
- Low external confidence means reality has not compelled acceptance
- The combination is healthy for speculative work

SEED succeeds if it:
- Clarifies thinking
- Reduces misinterpretation
- Avoids explanatory inflation

It fails if it:
- Becomes a belief system
- Absorbs contradictory evidence
- Expands beyond its stated scope

---

## Closing Note

These confidence estimates are **not endorsements**.

They reflect that SEED v1.0 is:
- Strongly coherent
- Carefully bounded
- Externally uncertain
- Appropriately modest

If new evidence emerges, confidence should change.
If no new evidence emerges, confidence should remain stable—not increase.

Under SEED, **uncertainty is not a flaw**. It is the expected condition.
