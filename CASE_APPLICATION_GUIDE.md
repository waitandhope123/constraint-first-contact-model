# Case Application Guide (How to Use SEED v1.0)

This document explains **how to apply the SEED v1.0 framework to real-world cases** in a disciplined, conservative manner.

SEED is not a case-explaining tool.  
It is a **case-filtering and consistency-testing framework**.

The goal is not to decide *what happened*, but to determine **whether SEED is even relevant** to a given case.

---

## Core Principle

**Most cases should be rejected.**

SEED is designed to apply to a *very small subset* of anomalous reports.  
If a case fits easily, it is probably being over-applied.

---

## Step 1: Initial Case Eligibility Screening

Before applying SEED, ask:

- Is the case based on a **single event or brief interval**?
- Is the data **fragmentary or ambiguous**, not comprehensive?
- Is there **no clear resolution** after time has passed?

If the case involves:
- long-term contact
- repeated messages
- escalating interaction
- detailed narratives
- ideological content

→ **Stop. SEED does not apply.**

---

## Step 2: Exclusion First (Most Important Step)

Reject the case immediately if **any** of the following are present:

- Clear pedagogical communication
- Explicit explanations of origin or intent
- Transfer of physical artifacts with provenance
- Repeated, structured contact over time
- Claims of instruction, warning, prophecy, or guidance
- Benefits conferred to the experiencer
- Clear incentives for hoax, belief formation, or social reinforcement

SEED is strongest when **almost nothing is given**.

---

## Step 3: Behavioral Signature Check

If the case survives exclusion, evaluate whether it shows:

- Procedural or task-like interaction
- Minimal or absent communication
- No attempt to persuade, reassure, or explain
- Lack of escalation or follow-up
- No correction of misunderstanding
- Abrupt termination without resolution

These are **necessary but not sufficient** conditions.

---

## Step 4: Information Pattern Analysis

Assess how information appears in the case:

- Is information sparse and bounded?
- Does it resist narrative closure?
- Are details incomplete or inconsistent rather than richly coherent?
- Does ambiguity persist despite reflection or investigation?

SEED predicts **information starvation**, not revelation.

---

## Step 5: Absence Pattern Evaluation

SEED relies heavily on *absence signals*. Ask:

- What *did not* happen that reasonably could have?
- What information was withheld despite opportunity?
- What actions were avoided?

Examples:
- No artifacts left behind
- No clear messages despite proximity
- No repeat appearances to clarify confusion

Consistent avoidance matters more than what is present.

---

## Step 6: Competing Explanation Check

Before considering SEED relevant, explicitly test:

- Psychological explanations
- Sociological and cultural context
- Misidentification or perceptual error
- Technological or experimental sources
- Reporting bias or retrospective reinterpretation

If any of these adequately explain the case, **SEED should not be invoked**.

SEED is a *last-resort lens*, not a first-pass explanation.

---

## Step 7: Relevance Determination (Not Conclusion)

If, and only if, the case:

- survives exclusion
- matches behavioral signatures
- exhibits information containment
- resists alternative explanations
- remains unresolved without escalation

Then SEED may be considered **internally compatible** with the case.

This does **not** mean:
- SEED explains the case
- the case supports SEED
- the case is external or non-human

Only that **SEED is not contradicted**.

---

## Common Misuse Warnings

Do **not** use SEED to:

- Validate personal experiences
- Assign intent or meaning
- Infer moral stance or interest
- Rank cases by “credibility”
- Argue for disclosure or suppression
- Replace psychological or scientific inquiry

SEED is not a diagnostic or interpretive authority.

---

## Proper Output of SEED Application

A correct SEED application should end with one of three conclusions:

1. **SEED does not apply**
2. **SEED is unnecessary**
3. **SEED is not contradicted, but unconfirmed**

There is intentionally **no positive confirmation category**.

---

## Documentation Recommendation

If documenting an application:

- Record reasons for rejection explicitly
- Avoid narrative language
- Separate observation from interpretation
- Preserve uncertainty
- Avoid accumulation of cases as evidence

SEED does not gain strength through quantity.

---

## Closing Note

SEED is a framework for **thinking clearly under uncertainty**, not resolving it.

If applied correctly, most cases will fail to qualify.
That outcome indicates correct usage, not failure.

The framework remains valid whether it is rarely applicable or never applicable.
